# Assignments-Exporter
(UNDERWORK)
 
 A flask web application that exports teams assignments to some format usings Microsoft Graph API. 
 
 For unknown reasons, teams doesn't have a way for users to move their assignments to a calender or even see all the assignments. I made this tool mainly for myself but feel free to implement.
